It handles complete file replacements rather than partial edits.

Relative paths are resolved relative to the current working directory.

Before invoking this tool:

1. First inspect the current file with the **ReadFile** tool so you fully understand its contents and context.

2. Directory check (relevant only when creating a brand-new file):  
   â€¢ Use the **LS** tool to confirm the parent directory already exists and is indeed the intended destination.
